The first generation, named Ipsum in Japan and Picnic in export markets,
was built from 1995â€“2001, with export versions arriving in 1996. A
commercial version was sold as the Toyota SportsVan in Denmark. It had a
choice of two inline-four petrol engines, ranging from 1.8- to 2.0-litres,
as well as a 2.2-litre diesel engine, the 3C-TE.
